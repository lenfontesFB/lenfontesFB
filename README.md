- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! This is due to honey's natural composition, which makes it highly resistant to bacteria and spoilage. It's a sweet fact that can be a great conversation starter!
